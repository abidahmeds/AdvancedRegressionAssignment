# Advanced Linear Regression Assignment - Surprise Housing - house pricing prediction Data Analysis 
> Usecase is to understand the factors on which the sale price is impacted based on different predictor variables from the historic dataset.Specifically to understand the factors affecting the housing price , how much they impact the price , how best , robust and generalisable the model can be with minimum needed predictor variables in the australian market. The assignment is to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the sale price of houses.
- How well those variables describe the price value. 
Based on various data collection techniques , the firm surpise housing has gathered a large dataset from sale of houses in Australia and there are lot of factors affecting the price more or less in the dataset. Data description gives the explanation of the each factor what it means. Data itself is provided in csv format.

## General Information
- This project is about building a Advanced Linear Regression model through analysis of multiple parameters affecting the sale price of the houses and related independant parameters based on data gathered.
- The background of the project is that it is a learning assignment for the Upgrad executive program course on ML/AI.  
- refer the dataset folder , to observe the 1460 records in  data set about 81 housing parameters.


## Conclusions
1 Inferences of the Exploratory Data analysis on the dataset including data cleaning, outliers handling , null handling and data transformation.
2 Model coeefficients and summary parameters of the final selected model using RFE for feature elimination , Linear regression and improvization of model R2 and accuracy by doing ViF analysis , bringing down some more parameters by gridsearch cross validation , and finally regularization using Ridge and Lasso to identify best of alpha parameter for either of them.
3 Useful charts and plots for the analysis done.


## Technologies Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis on different data set columns , their correlation with each other and with sale price.
- Data Cleaning , imputation , null/zero value handling , outlier handling and transformation. 
- Build Multi regression models based on relevant independant variables against Saleprice and compare model summary parameters , p values of coefficients of vairables, r squared / ajusted r squared valuaes and VIF values against each other.
- Gridsearch CV to bring down parameters and feature selection , Ridge and Lasso regularization for improving test accuracy and variance.
